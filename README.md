TODO:
1. I broke `Weekly Summary` and `Weekly rate` plot. To be fixed.
2. Understand how `plateau detection` is designed, and fix it.
3. Learn D3 and how it is used in this project.
4. Fix weird artifacts when then visibility is modified.
5. Make raw data toggable.

Ideas:
1. Maybe EventHandlers should explicitly subscribe to state changes.
