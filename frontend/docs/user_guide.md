## Advanced Analytics

### 📅 Weekend vs Weekday Analysis

**What it does:** Compares your eating and training patterns between weekdays and weekends.

**Metrics Shown:**
| Metric | Weekdays | Weekends |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Average Calories | Mon-Fri average | Sat-Sun average |
| Daily Weight Change | Typical fluctuation | Weekend impact |
| Volatility | Stability measure | Stability measure |

**Key Insight:** Shows "Weekend Calorie Difference" - if positive, you're eating more on weekends which may slow progress. The panel suggests a weekday calorie buffer if needed.

---

### 🔮 Weight Predictions

**What it does:** Projects your future weight based on current trends with confidence intervals.

**Time Frames:**
| Period | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| 4 weeks | Short-term planning |
| 8 weeks | Medium-term goals |
| 12 weeks | Competition prep, phases |

**Reading the Predictions:**
- **Expected** - Most likely weight based on current rate
- **Range** - Best/worst case based on your rate variability
- **Confidence %** - Higher = more reliable prediction

---

### 📊 Adaptive Benchmarks

**What it does:** Compares your current rate to your personal history, not generic standards.

**Features:**
- **Percentile Ranking** - "You're in the 75th percentile of your bulk phases"
- **Rate Comparison** - Current rate vs your historical average
- **Personal Records** - Your best bulk and cut rates

**Why it matters:** Generic advice says "lose 0.5-1kg/week" but YOUR sustainable rate might be different. This shows what actually works for you.

---

### 🔍 Calorie Accuracy Audit

**What it does:** Compares expected weight change (from logged calories) vs actual change to identify logging accuracy issues.

**Accuracy Score:**
| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80-100% | Excellent - logging is accurate |
| 60-79% | Good - minor discrepancies |
| 40-59% | Moderate - check portion sizes |
| <40% | Poor - significant underreporting likely |

**Possible Reasons for Discrepancy:**
- Underreporting (snacks, cooking oils, drinks)
- TDEE estimate too high/low
- Water retention fluctuations

**Weekly Breakdown:** Shows expected vs actual change for each week.

---

### 📈 Monthly/Quarterly Reports

**What it does:** Generates periodic summaries of your progress.

**Monthly View:**
- Start/end weight for each month
- Average calories and rate
- Consistency score (% of days logged)
- Weight range (min-max)

**Quarterly View:**
- Aggregated progress across 3 months
- Phase breakdown
- Average consistency

**Highlights:**
- 🏆 Best Month - highest consistency
- 📊 Total Progress - overall weight change

---

### 💡 What Worked

**What it does:** Analyzes your most successful periods to identify winning patterns.

**Insights Generated:**
| Insight | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Best Cut Calories | "Around 1800 kcal/day achieved -0.7 kg/week" |
| Best Bulk Calories | "Around 2600 kcal/day achieved +0.2 kg/week" |
| Volume Impact | "Higher volume correlates with more weight loss" |
| Longest Phase | "You can sustain cuts for 10+ weeks" |
| Consistency Impact | "Consistent weeks average better results" |

**Why it matters:** Instead of following generic advice, use YOUR proven strategies.

---

### 🚀 Plateau Breaker

**What it does:** Detects if you're in a plateau and suggests strategies based on your history.

**Plateau Detection:**
- Triggers when absolute weekly rate < 0.15 kg for 14+ days
- Shows duration and stable weight

**Suggestions (Prioritized):**
1. **Based on Your History** - What broke past plateaus
2. **Diet Break** - If plateau > 21 days
3. **Increase Activity** - Add steps or sessions
4. **Water Retention Check** - Sodium, stress, sleep
5. **Tracking Audit** - Re-weigh portions

**Historical Plateaus:** Shows when past plateaus occurred and how they were broken.

---

### 〰️ Rolling Averages

**What it does:** Displays 7-day, 14-day, and 30-day rolling averages for trend comparison.

**Reading the Averages:**
| Average | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| 7-Day | Short-term trend, responsive |
| 14-Day | Medium-term, balances noise |
| 30-Day | Long-term trend, stable |

**Momentum Indicator:**
- Compares 7-day to 30-day average
- **Gaining** = short-term trending higher
- **Losing** = short-term trending lower
- **Stable** = aligned trends

**Reversal Detection:** Alerts when short-term trend opposes long-term (potential turning point).

**Tip:** When 7-day average crosses above 30-day, it often signals a trend reversal.

---

## Tips for Best Results

### Weighing Consistency

For accurate trend analysis:
- Weigh at the **same time** each day (morning after bathroom, before eating)
- Use the **same scale** on a hard, flat surface
- Weigh **daily** for best SMA/EMA smoothing, or at minimum 3x per week

### Understanding Data Noise

Daily weight fluctuates due to:
- Water retention
- Sodium intake
- Carbohydrate intake
- Bowel movements
- Hormonal cycles

**Don't panic over single-day changes.** Focus on the SMA line for true trends.

### Setting Realistic Goals

| Goal Type | Recommended Rate |
|-----------|------------------|
| Fat Loss | -0.5 to -1.0 kg/week |
| Lean Bulk | +0.1 to +0.25 kg/week |
| Aggressive Cut | -0.75 to -1.0 kg/week |
| Competition Prep | Consult a coach |

### Using Phases Effectively

A typical yearly structure:
1. **Bulk Phase** (12-16 weeks): Build muscle with moderate surplus
2. **Maintenance** (4 weeks): Stabilize and recover
3. **Cut Phase** (8-12 weeks): Reduce body fat
4. **Maintenance** (4+ weeks): Settle at new weight

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Chart not loading | Check browser console for errors, ensure data.json is valid |
| CORS error | Use a local server (`live-server`), don't open file directly |
| Stats showing N/A | Ensure enough data points exist in the selected range |
| Goal line missing | Verify goal date is within visible range |
